# lamg.FsReadLine

This is a GNU readline implementation written purely in F#. This is a fork
of the original code at https://github.com/B2R2-org/FsReadLine

Currently FsReadLine minimally supports command line history, automatic tab
completion, and several keyboard shortcuts. Thus, we are widely open for PRs.

To see what this library does, simply run the demo project:

``` bash
$ dotnet run --project src/FsReadLine.Demo
```
